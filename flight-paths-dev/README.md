# flight-paths

A [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/) community visualisation tool to create bespoke [animated, connected scatter plots](https://observablehq.com/@d3/connected-scatterplot) using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) created by [Michael Hodge](github.com/mshodge). Here is a [Data Studio example of violin](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/13679fea-2a83-4e91-9c52-91589f988915).

## Background

[Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/) is a powerful tool to create dashboards and visualisations. The user can upload local data, or use data contained within another Google product (such as Google Sheets or Google BigQuery). Scatter plots in Data Studio are static and therefore cannot be easily used to tell a 'story'.

We have here created a community visualisation to generate animated, connected scatter plots based on input data.

## Data

flight-paths uses two Metrics you want to plot against each other, and then a third Metric you want to use to aggregate the raw data (such as year).
